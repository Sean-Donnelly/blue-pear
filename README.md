Bloo is a network security monitoring (NSM) toolset for use by a deploying blue team.  Bloo is similar to other NSM platforms (ROCK NSM, CozyNSM, Security Onion, etc.) but differs in the following ways:
* emphasis on deeper and more efficient analysis of full packet capture
* meant as a one-person deployment (personnel constrained teams); the toolset lacks access control and collaboration tools
* designed to operate on a hardware constrained network (minimal deployed assets)
* incorporates logstash configs developed by Justin Henderson (H&A Security Solutions) for data enrichment
* utilizes various analytic frameworks (by Austin Taylor and Mark Baggett)
* employs up-to-date versions of Elastic applications
* includes training aids (workflows and hunt matrix templates)
