Blue P.E.A.R is a network security monitoring (NSM) tool suite for use by a deploying blue team.  It spawned from a need for a more efficient and lightweight NSM for network-based (passive) threat hunting.  Blue P.E.A.R allows an analyst to:
* seamlessly transition between log review and netflow or full packet capture analysis
* single-handedly deploy a kit and conduct hunts
* operate using a hardware-contrained network
* make use of various open-source analytic frameworks, Bro scripts, and Logstash configs for data enrichment
* employs up-to-date versions of Elastic applications
* utilize training aids (workflows and hunt matrix templates)
